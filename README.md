# image-database

This project is supposed to save and respond with images to the user. It should have a username/password authentication to access your own images. The images should also be groupable together, with each image being able to be in more than one group. Each group or image should also have a text associated with it. It should also allow directly linking to a single image or group without authentication, if the user has allowed it. The language used is Typescript.
