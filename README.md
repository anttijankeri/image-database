# object-database

This project is supposed to save and send objects with linked images and text/other values. The data saved per object should be typable to customize validation and retrieval. Objects should be saved as **json** files. Objects should be creatable without any accompanying data if needed. Each object should be retrievable as its own unit, with all the accompanying data. The text/other values should be configurable based on the database needs. The user should also be able to search/filter objects based on those values. The user's objects should be locked behind authentication (cookie-based sessions.) The user should also have the choice of exposing an object or image to others. Objects should also be groupable together.

This repo uses **Typescript**
